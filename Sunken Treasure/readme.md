Original source code for Sunken Treasure C64 version 1.0, 13th January 1985 There were several revisions 
made to Sunken Treasure over the years, with 1986 version 2.0 got an all-new title screen with sprite logo 
but the rest of the code reminded the same. Version 2 was released and through Mailsoft Pty Ltd and sold 
via mail order and small outlets.

In 1987 I converted this adventure to The Quill. Only a few things were changed. The Quilled version was 
known as version 3.0 and was released and sold in Australia by Entertainment Software. This release also 
received a new bitmapped title screen.
