Original source code for Sunken Treasure C64 version 1.0, 13th January 1985 There were several 
revisions made to Sunken Treasure over the years, with 1986 version 2.0 got an all-new title 
screen with sprite logo but the rest of the code reminded the same. Version 2 was released and 
through Mailsoft Pty Ltd and sold via mail order and small outlets.

In 1987 I converted this adventure to The Quill. Only a few things were changed. The Quilled 
version was known as version 3.0 and was released and sold in Australia by Entertainment Software. 
This release also received a new bitmapped title screen.
