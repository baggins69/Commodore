VIC20

Sunken Treasure text adventure for the Commodore VIC 20 (unexplaned 3.5k)

Towards the end of 1983, I wrote several text adventure games for the Commodore VIC 20. 
Inspired by the classic Commodore released cartridge-based text adventures by Scott Adams, 
especially AdventureLand and Pirate Cove, I started programming my series.

I had grand plans to release dozens of text adventures and started drawing maps, planning 
gameplay and puzzles and learning to code, but soon I realised that fitting a text adventure 
into 3.5K of memory was hard, very hard. I thought it would be impossible.

After a few months, learning to code and trying everything I could to fit a game into such a 
small amount of memory I finally completed two games, although I started work on a 3rd but 
gave up on the VIC and moved to the C64 and released Ship Wrecked a few years later.

Adventure #1 – Pirate House

Adventure #2 – Sunken Treasure

I released both of these titles limited numbers via mail order but never kept a fully working copy. 
As time went on the only thing that remained were my handwritten notes, code scribbles and sketched maps.
