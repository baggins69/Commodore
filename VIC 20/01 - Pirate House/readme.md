# VIC-20 Text Adventures

Text adventure games for the Commodore VIC-20 (unexpanded 3.5K)
Towards the end of 1983, I wrote several text adventure games for the Commodore VIC-20. Inspired by the classic Commodore released cartridge-based text adventures by Scott Adams, especially AdventureLand and Pirate Cove, I started programming my own series.

I had grand plans to release dozens of text adventures and started drawing maps, planning gameplay and puzzles, and learning to code. But I soon realised that fitting a text adventure into 3.5K of memory was hard, very hard. I thought it would be impossible.
After a few months of learning to code and trying everything I could to fit a game into such a small amount of memory, I finally completed two games and partially finished several others before moving to the Commodore 64 in early 1984.

The Original Six Adventures (1983-1984)

**Adventure #1 – Pirate House** ✓ Available

**Adventure #2 – Sunken Treasure** ✓ Available

**Adventure #3 – Escape from Alcatraz** ✓ Available

**Adventure #4 – Search for the Golden Eagle** ⚙️ In Development

**Adventure #5 – Rebel Fighter** ⚙️ In Development

**Adventure #6 – House of Terror** ⚙️ In Development

I released the first two titles in limited numbers via mail order but never kept fully working copies. As time went on, the only things that remained were my handwritten notes, code scribbles, and sketched maps.
The Resurrection Project (2020-2025)

Four decades later, I embarked on a mission to reconstruct these lost games from their original documentation. Between 2020 and 2024, I successfully recreated Pirate House and Sunken Treasure from handwritten notes, and completed Escape from Alcatraz—a game inspired by watching the Clint Eastwood movie one evening in 1983 but never finished at the time.

Work has now commenced on the final three adventures, bringing this 40-year journey full circle. Each game maintains the original 1983 design philosophy and fits within the unexpanded VIC-20's 3.5K memory constraint.
